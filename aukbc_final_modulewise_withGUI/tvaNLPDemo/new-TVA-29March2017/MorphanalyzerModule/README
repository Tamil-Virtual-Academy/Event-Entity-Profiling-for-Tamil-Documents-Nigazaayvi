Description:

AUKBC Tamil Morphanalyser v1.0: This takes a text file in UTF-8 as input, where each line consists of a single word and the word is analysed for its morphological features. It assigns the morph information to each word in the sentence. 
This uses a paradigm based approach, using Finite State Automata (FSA).

-----------------------------
a)Operating System		:    LINUX/UNIX system (preffered Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
