AUKBC Tamil Clause Tagger 1.0

Description: 
------------

AUKBC Tamil Clause Tagger v1.0: This takes a text file in UTF-8 with Part-of-Speech(POS) tag, Chunk tags and morph tags as input and assigns the clause boundary for each sentence. 
This is developed using Hybrid approach, where both Machine Learning and Linguistic rules are used. We have used Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)(Taku Kudo's'[1] CRFs implementation) for the Machine Learning(ML).

   https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/
